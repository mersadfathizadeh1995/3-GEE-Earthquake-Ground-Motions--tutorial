Earthquake Ground Motions

From Kramer (1996)
One of the Primary Goals of Geotechnical Earthquake 
Engineers is to Predict:
• Intensity (Amplitude) 
• Frequency Content 
• Duration
for seismic ground motions from the 
fault source to the site of interest.
Earthquake Ground Motions

What Parameters effect Intensity, Frequency Content, and 
Duration?
• Earthquake Magnitude 
• Distance from the fault (near fault effects)
• Site Conditions (local, near surface)
• Fault type/tectonic setting
• Travel Path Geology (Deep in the earth) (Eastern vs 
Western Rock)
• Special Effects
• Directivity, basin/topographic
With every Earthquake our database of recorded 
ground motions increases. This helps us further 
understand how the parameter listed above affect 
ground motions.
Most earthquake ground motions are presently 
recorded with accelerometers.
Small amplitude ground motions may be 
recorded using velocity meters.

As recordings are made further from Earthquake epicenter
•
Intensity: Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) decreases (attenuate) 
•
P, S waves: separate more at distance 2*thickness of the crust (~50 
miles) Surface wave amplitudes produce peak GM’s at larger distances.
•
Frequency content: As distance increases, high 
frequencies attenuate (because the earth is a low pass 
filter and as distance increases high frequencies will 
damp out)
•
Duration: As distance increases, duration increases

1. Intensity (amplitude)
•
Generally, measure motions in 3 orthogonal directions (Vert, N-S, 
E-W). Can transform to fault parallel, fault horizontal.
•
The basic form is the ground motions are time histories (time 
versus acceleration).
•
Often directly measure acceleration for strong ground motion and 
integrate to get velocity and displacement.

Engineers typically assume horizontals motions are more damaging than vertical 
motions. Vertical motions can be important for rotating or sensitive equipment or 
structures. 
•
Factors of safety against gravity-induced static vertical forces in buildings 
usually provides adequate resistance to vertical forces during earthquakes

Typically, V/H ratios are used to estimate the vertical spectrum. 
Bozorgnia and Campbell (2004) is generally considered the standard for V/H ratios, 
but newer approaches are available.
ASCE 7-16 code addresses vertical ground motions.
V/H can be very large (2-5 in certain frequency ranges) if large Horz ground motions 
are expected.

Earthquake Ground Motions
1. Intensity (amplitude)
•
Main parameters used 
•
Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) 
•
Most commonly used ground motion parameter
•
Largest value of horizontal acceleration, absolute
•
In general, as PGA goes up, damage goes up, but it is 
dependent on building period. 
•
Peak Ground Velocity (PGV)
•
More accurate at intermediate frequencies since less 
sensitive to high frequencies, may be a better indicator of 
potential damage.
•
Peak Ground Displacement (PGD)
•
Typically associated with low frequency content, less 
common since errors can occur during signal processing.

What is the potential problem with just using PGA?
Damage may be closely related to PGA in many cases, but 
other cases repeated applications of high amplitude cycles 
are more damaging
For the Melendy Ranch recording station:
The 1972 Stone Canyon Earthquake (M=4.6) and the 1967 
Koyna Earthquake (M=6.5) have the same PGA, but the 
Koyna record has many more cycles of high amplitude 
than the Stone Canyon record.

Near Fault Effects
•
Near fault effects are for distances (R) < 10-20 km 
from fault
1.
Rupture directivity: enhanced long-period  energy 
when fault ruptures toward the site (forward 
directivity).
•
Fault rupture is like ripping a piece of cloth. The 
rupture can initiate and rip either or both 
directions. 
•
The fault ruptures propagates at a velocity 
approximately equal to Vs (~ 3 km/sec)
•
Each rupture point is initiating shear waves that 
radiate away from that point
•
All shear waves arrive at B at the same time 
producing a high amplitude, short duration pulse 
(Forward Directivity)
•
S-waves arrive at A all spread out producing a 
low amplitude, long duration pulse     
(Backward Directivity)

Rupture
Direction
Forward rupture directivity effects occur when two conditions are met: the rupture front propagates toward the site, and 
the direction of slip on the fault is aligned with the site. The conditions for generating forward rupture directivity effects 
are readily met in strike-slip faulting, where the fault slip direction is oriented horizontally in the direction along the 
strike of the fault, and rupture propagates horizontally along strike either unilaterally or bilaterally. However, not all 
near-fault locations experience forward rupture directivity effects in a given event. Backward directivity effects, which 
occur when the rupture propagates away from the site, give rise to the opposite effect: long duration motions having low 
amplitudes at long periods, as shown in Figures 1 and 3. A qualitative description of these effects was presented by 
Archuleta and Hartzell (1981) using data from the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake.
The conditions required for forward directivity are also met in 
dip-slip faulting, including both reverse and normal faults. The 
alignment of both the rupture direction and the slip direction 
up the fault plane produces rupture directivity effects at sites 
located around the surface exposure of the fault (or its updip 
projection if it does not break the surface).

Near Fault Effects
Shahi and Baker (2014)
It is not easy to classify a motion as pulse or non-pulse (i.e., 
containing directivity effects). 
Shahi and Baker (2014) use the PGV classify ground 
motions.
(if PI >0 is pulse)
Classifying motions as Pulse or non-pulse is important so 
that ground motion modeling can include directive in the 
design ground motions.

Near Fault Effects
As required by many codes, near fault effects have to be 
considered for sites within 9.5 miles of the surface projection 
of an active fault capable of producing a Mw 7 or larger 
event
or 6.25 miles of the surface projection of an active fault 
capable of producing a Mw 6 or larger event
EXCEPTIONS:
1. Faults with estimated slip rate along the fault less than
0.04 in. (1 mm) per year shall not be considered.
2. The surface projection shall not include portions of the
fault at depths of 6.25 mi (10 km) or greater.
The code does not explicitly account for near fault effects.
Shahi and Baker (2014) provide a period-by-period multiplier for 
SaRotD100/SaRotD50 to apply to the response spectra to adjust it from 
the median to the dominate direction of motion. (Designed for 
NGA West 2)
Abrahamson (2000)

Other GMPEs.

Topographic Effects
(1) The maximum amplification attributed to topography occurs at, or near, the peak of the 
ridge, the maximum deamplification occurs near the toe (base) of the feature, and irregular 
amplification-deamplification patterns are observed in between.

(2) The observed, or computed, amplification is related to the “sharpness” of the topography: 
the steeper the average slope, the higher the amplification. 
Higher amp
Lower amp
(3) The amplifications are highly frequency-dependent and seem to occur at wavelengths (λ) 
comparable to a characteristic length of the feature, such as width and/or height (Paolucci 
2002, Ashford et al. 1997).

from D. Assimaki (after Geli et al. 1988)
•
Experimental Field Studies: 
Topographic amplification factors ranging from 
3 – 6 are common (e.g., Spudich et al. 1996; 
Massa et al. 2010; Hough et al. 2011) with 
some studies indicating values of 10-plus (e.g., 
Beuch et al. 2010) 
•
Numerical Simulations:                   
Qualitative agreement exists between 
experimental data and 2D and 3D numerical 
simulations .  However, numerical simulations 
rarely predict topographic amplification factors 
greater than 3, with common values less than 
2 (e.g., Paolucci 2002; Papadimitriou 2011)

the amplification is

Topographic Effects
My recommendations:
Use the Paolucci 2002 approach to estimate the 
topographic amplification frequency range. 
Frequency = (0.7 to 1.0) (Vsavg/Length) for ridge 
features.
Can also use Ashford et al. (1997) estimate 
ft0 = Vsavg/5.0*Height
Amplifications of 2.5-3.25 times the flat ground 
response are typical, but isolated or peninsula 
type features can have amplification of 10 times.

Basin Effects
Seismic waves (Rayleigh waves) can be trapped in the 
basin and therefore, longer duration and higher ground 
motions (constructive interference) are observed
Significant amplifications can occur near the edge of the 
basin as Rayleigh wave strike and bounce off the edge of 
the basin (i.e., impedance difference)
We still don’t have a good enough understanding to capture 
basin effects in edge and deep basins, but do ok with 
shallow basins. (Mostly taken into effect with GMPE via 
Z1.0 and Z2.5 terms along with Vs30 terms).
